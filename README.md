Healthcare Data Analysis Using MySQL

Project Overview

This project involves the analysis of healthcare data using MySQL Workbench. The dataset comprises five key tables: patients, doctors, appointments, billing, and prescriptions. The objective is to extract meaningful insights, identify trends, and perform data-driven queries to enhance the understanding of healthcare operations.

Dataset

	•	Patients: Contains information about the patients, including demographic details.
	•	Doctors: Details of doctors, their specialties, and experience.
	•	Appointments: Information regarding appointments scheduled between patients and doctors.
	•	Billing: Records of the billing transactions, including payment methods, charges, and status.
	•	Prescriptions: Details of prescriptions written by doctors, including the medications prescribed and dosages.

Project Features

	•	Data Analysis: Queries were designed to extract key insights like patient demographics, doctor specialties, appointment frequencies, billing trends, and prescription patterns.
	•	SQL Queries: Custom SQL queries were written for complex joins, aggregations, and filtering to derive meaningful results.
	•	Data Cleaning: Basic data cleaning operations were performed to handle missing or inconsistent data within the database.
	•	Visualization: Results were visualized using MySQL Workbench’s output and charting features to represent key findings.

Key Queries

	•	Top Doctors by Appointment Count: Finding which doctors have the highest number of appointments.
	•	Frequent Patients: Identifying patients with the highest number of visits.
	•	Billing Insights: Analyzing revenue by payment method and identifying outstanding bills.
	•	Prescription Analysis: Assessing the most frequently prescribed medications by specialty.
	•	Appointment Trends: Detecting patterns in appointment bookings across different time periods.

Tools Used

	•	MySQL Workbench: For writing queries, data cleaning, and running SQL commands.
	•	GitHub: To manage the project and maintain version control.

How to Run

	1.	Clone the repository to your local machine.
	2.	Import the dataset (provided in SQL format named healthcare.sql) into MySQL Workbench.
	3.	Execute the provided SQL queries to reproduce the analysis.

Future Work

	•	Adding more complex queries for deeper insights.
	•	Visualizing data with external tools like Power BI or Tableau.
